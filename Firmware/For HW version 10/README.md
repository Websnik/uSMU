# Calibration
Calibration in the uSMU is always inhereted from a trustworthy source, for example another SMU or multimeter. Fortunately, for many solar cell applications, a decent handheld multimeter is "good enough" as a calibration source. 

There are 4 things we must calibrate:

1. The relationship between the voltage DAC (DAC8571) level and the actual voltage applied to the DUT via the output amplifier (LT1970)
2. The relationship between the voltage level measured by the ADC, and the actual voltage being applied to the DUT
3. The amount of current flowing through the current-sense circuit when no DUT is attached (See below)
4. The relationship between the level of the current limit DAC (onboard the STM32F072) and the actual amount of current allowed to flow to or from the DUT

Point 3 is an interesting one. Even when no DUT is connected, there are still paths for current to flow through the current shunt as (poorly) illustrated below. The solution is to measure the stray current across the uSMU's voltage range, and subtract it from our device measurements to give a true current flow to and from the DUT

## Calibration procedure
### To calibrate the voltage DAC
1. Attach a voltmeter to the uSMU and enable the output (`CH1:ENA`)
2. For a few points between 0 and 65536, set the voltage DAC to different values and record the voltmeter output. For example, `DAC 15000` to set the DAC to 15000, or approximately 0.9375 V
3. Plot the measured voltage against DAC level as illustrated below. Calculate the slope and y-axis intercept through a linear regression (Line should be straight)
4. Store the calibration data in the SMU by sending (as in the example below) `CAL:DAC 5284.4 32532`
5. Reboot the SMU either by power cycling or by sending `*RST`

### To calibrate the voltage ADC
1. Attach a voltmeter to the uSMU and enable the output (`CH1:ENA`)
2. Send the command `CH1:VCAL`. This will enable a calibration mode and allow voltage measurements to return the raw ADC output
3. For a few points, request measurements over the uSMU's measurement range and record the ouput. For example `CH1:MEA:VOL -5`, `CH1:MEA:VOL -2.5`, `CH1:MEA:VOL 0`, etc. The output returned will look something like `16532, 2.04E-6` where `16532` represents the raw ADC's voltage level to be recorded.
4. Plot ADC voltage level against the set voltage and calculate the slope and intercept (as illustrated below)
5. Store the calibration data in the SMU by sending (as in the example below) `CAL:VOL 4.99E-4 -6.11`
6. Reboot the uSMU for calibration data to take effect

### To calibrate the zero-current offset
This is a little onerous, but it is best to calibrate each current range individually. Ranges correspond to set levels of gain on the current sense amplifier
  | Range #     | PGA gain  |
  | ------------|-----------|
  | 1           | 1.375x    |
  | 2           | 8x        |
  | 3           | 64x       | 
  | 4           | 176x      |
  
  1. Unplug everything attached to the uSMU's BNC connector and enable the SMU output `CH1:ENA`
  2. Send `CH1:RANGEx` where x is the desired range to calibrate, eg `CH1:RANGE1`. This will disable the automatic range switching and remove any zero-current offsets from RAM (not stored offsets)
  3. For a few points, request measurements at different voltage levels and record the voltage and current outputs
  4. Plot the measured voltage against measured current and calculate the slope and intercept
  5. Notice that, despite nothing connected, there is still some current flowing!
  6. Store the calibration data in the SMU by sending (as in the example below) `CAL:CUR:RANGE4 -1.55E-7 3.28E-7`
  7. Reboot the SMU and repeat for other current ranges.

### To calibrate the current limit DAC

1. Attach a current meter to the uSMU's BNC cable. This should present a dead short to the SMU
2. Enable the SMU's output (`CH1:ENA`) and set the voltage to a high number (`CH1:VOL 5`)
3. For a few points, manually set the current limit DAC to different levels between 200-4000 and measure the current flowing through the current meter at each point. For example, send `ILIM 2048` to set the DAC to its midpoint
4. Plot current meter output (in mA) against the DAC level and calulate the slope and intercept
5. Store the calibration data in the SMU by sending `CAL:ILIM 63.044 -9.789` as in the example below
6. Reboot the SMU
