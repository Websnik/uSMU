# μSMU

μSMU is a small [source-measure unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_measure_unit) designed for the very low-cost electrical characterisation of photovoltaic cells.

## Background

SMUs are "4-quadrant" devices, meaning they can both source **and** sink current at both positive **and** negative voltages. This makes them very useful for semiconductor device characterisation - including LEDs, transistors and solar cells.

In photovoltaic research laboratories, a SMU is typically used to vary the voltage applied to an illuminated solar cell, whilst simultaneously measuring the current. This voltage sweep allows us to plot the solar cell's I-V characteristics, and calculate its light-to-power conversion efficiency.

SMUs are generalised pieces of test equipment, designed to be highly sensitive over vast current & voltage ranges. For example, the workhorse [Keithley 2400](https://uk.tek.com/keithley-source-measure-units/keithley-smu-2400-series-sourcemeter) has a voltage range between 100 nV and 200 V, and a current range between 1 pA to 10 A. This is likely overkill for most research and education applications concerning solar cells, which tend to operate between 0-5 V and μA to mA. The μSMU doesn't intend to replace precision SMUs, rather to supplement them in cost-sensitive areas where such precision is not required.
