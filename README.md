# μSMU

μSMU is a small [source-measure unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_measure_unit) designed for the very low-cost electrical characterisation of photovoltaic cells.

## Background

SMUs are "4-quadrant" devices, meaning they can both source **and** sink current at both positive **and** negative voltages. This makes them very useful for semiconductor device characterisation - including LEDs, transistors and solar cells.

In photovoltaic research laboratories, a SMU is typically used to vary the voltage applied to an illuminated solar cell, whilst simultaneously measuring the current. This voltage sweep allows us to plot the solar cell's I-V characteristics, and calculate its light-to-power conversion efficiency.

SMUs are generalised pieces of test equipment, designed to be highly sensitive over vast current & voltage ranges. For example, the workhorse [Keithley 2400](https://uk.tek.com/keithley-source-measure-units/keithley-smu-2400-series-sourcemeter) has a voltage range between 100 nV and 200 V, and a current range between 1 pA to 10 A. This is likely overkill for most research and education applications concerning solar cells, which tend to operate between 0-5 V and μA to mA. The μSMU doesn't intend to replace precision SMUs, rather to supplement them in cost-sensitive areas where such precision is not required.



## Function
The μSMU is largely inspired by [Linear Technology's DC2591A evaluation board](https://www.analog.com/media/en/dsp-documentation/evaluation-kit-manuals/855-DC2591A_REV01_DEMO_MANUAL.PDF), which demonstrates an I2C address translator IC to interface up to 8 modules containing several I2C devices with an Arduino-style board. Someone consequentially, these boards also contain fantastic SMU circuits! 

The voltage applied to the device-under-test (DUT) is supplied by a LT1970 opamp driven by a 12-bit DAC on the non-inverting input and a 2.048V reference on the inverting input. The current flowing through the DUT is measured by amplifying the voltage drop through a high-side 10 Ohm shunt resistor. Both the DUT voltage and shunt resistor voltage drop are measured using a 16-bit ADC. The whole system is controlled using a STM32F072 microcontroller, which presents a USB virtual communications port for interfacing.
